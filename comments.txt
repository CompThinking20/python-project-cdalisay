This looks great so far. There is a way to simplify this class, so that you don't need a new method to set every single stat. That would keep your code a bit cleaner and less prone to error, but I think right now this is good for where this project is. I would assume your next step is creating a function—or perhaps a "game" class with multiple methods on it—and then using players to actually play. Get in touch if you need any help conceptualizing this.
