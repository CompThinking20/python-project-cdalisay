This looks great so far. There is a way to simplify this class, so that you don't need a new method to set every single stat. That would keep your code a bit cleaner and less prone to error, but I think right now this is good for where this project is. I would assume your next step is creating a function—or perhaps a "game" class with multiple methods on it—and then using players to actually play. Get in touch if you need any help conceptualizing this.

I really have nothing to add here: there are no obvious errors, and it looks like generally clean and thoughtful code. As I said in my previous comments, there are definitely ways to reduce some typing—and therefore potential for bugs—but that's a minor quibble given the scope of the project. For you final submission: get some players playing!
